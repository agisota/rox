/**
 * Typed I/O port values — the small vocabulary a node port's `type` string is
 * drawn from, plus a pure compatibility check used by `validateGraph` (graph
 * persistence) and the desktop canvas connection guard (drag-time).
 *
 * The values are JSON-Schema `type` keywords plus a few domain shapes the merged
 * pipeline nodes actually produce (`message`, `chunks`, `rows`, `vector`). They
 * stay strings so the existing `BlockPort.type` / `NodePort.type` field needs no
 * shape change — typing a port is just setting `type` to one of these.
 *
 * Compatibility is intentionally permissive and ADDITIVE: `any` (and an absent
 * type — i.e. a legacy, untyped port) is compatible with everything. A concrete
 * type is only incompatible with a *different* concrete type. This keeps every
 * existing untyped graph valid while still catching an obviously-wrong wire
 * (e.g. a `vector` output dragged into a `message` input).
