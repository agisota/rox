# Next.js App Router Patterns

Comprehensive patterns for Next.js 14+ App Router architecture, Server Components, and modern full-stack React development.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building new Next.js applications with App Router
- Migrating from Pages Router to App Router
- Implementing Server Components and streaming
- Setting up parallel and intercepting routes
- Optimizing data fetching and caching
- Building full-stack features with Server Actions

## Core Concepts

### 1. Rendering Modes

| Mode | Where | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Server Components** | Server only | Data fetching, heavy computation, secrets |
| **Client Components** | Browser | Interactivity, hooks, browser APIs |
| **Static** | Build time | Content that rarely changes |
| **Dynamic** | Request time | Personalized or real-time data |
| **Streaming** | Progressive | Large pages, slow data sources |

### 2. File Conventions

```
app/
├── layout.tsx       # Shared UI wrapper
├── page.tsx         # Route UI
├── loading.tsx      # Loading UI (Suspense)
├── error.tsx        # Error boundary
├── not-found.tsx    # 404 UI
├── route.ts         # API endpoint
├── template.tsx     # Re-mounted layout
├── default.tsx      # Parallel route fallback
└── opengraph-image.tsx  # OG image generation
```
