# SQL Optimization Patterns

Transform slow database queries into lightning-fast operations through systematic optimization, proper indexing, and query plan analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

- Debugging slow-running queries
- Designing performant database schemas
- Optimizing application response times
- Reducing database load and costs
- Improving scalability for growing datasets
- Analyzing EXPLAIN query plans
- Implementing efficient indexes
- Resolving N+1 query problems

## Core Concepts

### 1. Query Execution Plans (EXPLAIN)

Understanding EXPLAIN output is fundamental to optimization.

**PostgreSQL EXPLAIN:**
```sql
-- Basic explain
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- With actual execution stats
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Verbose output with more details
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
SELECT u.*, o.order_total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```
